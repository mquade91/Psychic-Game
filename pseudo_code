computer makes choice
	the choice comes from an array of options that you created
	the choice is randomly generated by a function

user makes a choice
	based off the key a user presses
	a list will generate this way the user can keep track of what they already guessed
		create variable thats an array
			push method push()



logic

if the computer and the user make the same guess = win	
	===, inside function vs outside function
if the guesses are not the same = loss

cant get inner HTML to work
how do i get the computer to guess a new number
